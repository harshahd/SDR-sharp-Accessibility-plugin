# SDR-sharp-Accessibility-plugin
This is a 3rd party plugin for SDR sharp that provides little keyboard accessibility
I downloaded it from http://www.nl14029-luisteramateur.nl/plugins.php and making available to all visually impaired SDR sharp users.
## how to make SDR sharp accessible by this plugin
1. Copy "SDRSharp.AccessibilityPlugin.dll" to your sdr sharp directory where "SDRSharp.exe" file exists.
2. open "magic line.txt", copy the line present in the text file.
3. Navigate to your SDR sharp folder where "SDRSharp.exe" exist.
4. Open "Plugins.xml" and paste the copied line inside <sharpPlugins> </sharpPlugins> tag.
5. To confirm plugin is working or not, open SDRSharp.exe and type "K" key to input any frequency.
Note:
As per my knowledge, this plugin only allows to enter frequencies in an accessible manner and also allows navigating in settings option.
This plugin is not completely accessible and has above mentioned limitations.
